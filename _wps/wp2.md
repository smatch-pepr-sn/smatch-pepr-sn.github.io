Enriching clinical trials with multi-sources and multidimensional auxiliary data: to develop 
the next generation of methods to combine high-throughput, high-dimensional individual 
and ancillary data in clinical trials and to evaluate their benefit.

Objectives:

 1. Integrate internal data, i.e., supplementing the clinical trial data with additional patient information by integrating high-dimensional omics data
 2. Integrate external multi-sources information (i.e. observational data), by
    1. selecting the relevant data to be used,
    2.  estimating heterogeneity and generalizing the treatment effects in other population, and
    3.  coping with information loss of interrupted clinical trials and avoiding research waste.
 3. Integrate auxiliary data (synthetic, observational, etc) to complete a partial 
clinical trial, i.e. emulating a trial by
    1. generation of in-silico or synthetic patients for clinical trials, and 
    2. from single arms studies toward generalization of finding.
