The global objective is to propose a methodological framework for accelerating 
drug development through mechanistic translational and bridging approaches, in 
order to refine and optimize animal experiments, gain information on PK/PD, and 
enable dose-finding and early selection for the Phase I/II clinical trials.

 1. Build physiologically-based PK (PBPK) and statistical methods that provide 
 results that are robust to model uncertainties to (1) predict clinical efficacy 
 of antivirals and vaccines using the large amounts of preclinical data that have 
 already been generated in COVID19 (2) develop a first-in- man exploratory clinical 
 trial design using microdosing PET data
 
 2. Develop early-phase clinical trial designs based on Bayesian adaptive approaches 
 for exploration and down-selection among multiple potential regimens based on 
 multivariate outcomes applied to vaccine development and drug resistant infections
